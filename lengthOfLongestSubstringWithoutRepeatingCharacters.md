Certainly! Let's break down the provided Python code step by step using the example string `s = "abcabcbb"`. The goal of the code is to find the length of the **longest substring without repeating characters** in the given string.

### **Code Overview**

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        charSet = set()
        print("charSet: ", charSet)
        left = 0
        res = 0

        for right in range(len(s)):
            while s[right] in charSet:
                charSet.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            charSet.add(s[right])
            res = max(res, right - left + 1)

        return res
```

### **Key Components**

1. **`charSet`**: A `set` to store the unique characters in the current window (substring) without duplicates.
2. **`left` and `right` Pointers**: These pointers define the current window's boundaries. `left` is the start, and `right` is the end of the window.
3. **`res`**: Stores the length of the longest substring found without repeating characters.

### **Step-by-Step Execution with `s = "abcabcbb"`**

Let's walk through the code execution step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - `charSet = {}` (empty set)
   - `left = 0`
   - `res = 0`
   - The `print` statement outputs: `charSet:  set()`

2. **Iteration 1 (`right = 0`, character `'a'`)**:
   - `'a'` is not in `charSet`.
   - Add `'a'` to `charSet`: `charSet = {'a'}`
   - Update `res`: `max(0, 0 - 0 + 1) = 1`
   - `res = 1`

3. **Iteration 2 (`right = 1`, character `'b'`)**:
   - `'b'` is not in `charSet`.
   - Add `'b'` to `charSet`: `charSet = {'a', 'b'}`
   - Update `res`: `max(1, 1 - 0 + 1) = 2`
   - `res = 2`

4. **Iteration 3 (`right = 2`, character `'c'`)**:
   - `'c'` is not in `charSet`.
   - Add `'c'` to `charSet`: `charSet = {'a', 'b', 'c'}`
   - Update `res`: `max(2, 2 - 0 + 1) = 3`
   - `res = 3`

5. **Iteration 4 (`right = 3`, character `'a'`)**:
   - `'a'` is already in `charSet`. This indicates a repeating character.
   - Enter the `while` loop to remove characters from the left until `'a'` is removed:
     - Remove `'a'` (`s[left] = 'a'`): `charSet = {'b', 'c'}`
     - Increment `left`: `left = 1`
   - Add `'a'` to `charSet`: `charSet = {'a', 'b', 'c'}`
   - Update `res`: `max(3, 3 - 1 + 1) = 3`
   - `res` remains `3`

6. **Iteration 5 (`right = 4`, character `'b'`)**:
   - `'b'` is already in `charSet`.
   - Enter the `while` loop:
     - Remove `'b'` (`s[left] = 'b'`): `charSet = {'a', 'c'}`
     - Increment `left`: `left = 2`
   - Add `'b'` to `charSet`: `charSet = {'a', 'b', 'c'}`
   - Update `res`: `max(3, 4 - 2 + 1) = 3`
   - `res` remains `3`

7. **Iteration 6 (`right = 5`, character `'c'`)**:
   - `'c'` is already in `charSet`.
   - Enter the `while` loop:
     - Remove `'c'` (`s[left] = 'c'`): `charSet = {'a', 'b'}`
     - Increment `left`: `left = 3`
   - Add `'c'` to `charSet`: `charSet = {'a', 'b', 'c'}`
   - Update `res`: `max(3, 5 - 3 + 1) = 3`
   - `res` remains `3`

8. **Iteration 7 (`right = 6`, character `'b'`)**:
   - `'b'` is already in `charSet`.
   - Enter the `while` loop:
     - Remove `'a'` (`s[left] = 'a'`): `charSet = {'b', 'c'}`
     - Increment `left`: `left = 4`
     - `'b'` is still in `charSet`, continue the loop.
     - Remove `'b'` (`s[left] = 'b'`): `charSet = {'c'}`
     - Increment `left`: `left = 5`
   - Add `'b'` to `charSet`: `charSet = {'b', 'c'}`
   - Update `res`: `max(3, 6 - 5 + 1) = 3`
   - `res` remains `3`

9. **Iteration 8 (`right = 7`, character `'b'`)**:
   - `'b'` is already in `charSet`.
   - Enter the `while` loop:
     - Remove `'c'` (`s[left] = 'c'`): `charSet = {'b'}`
     - Increment `left`: `left = 6`
     - `'b'` is still in `charSet`, continue the loop.
     - Remove `'b'` (`s[left] = 'b'`): `charSet = set()`
     - Increment `left`: `left = 7`
   - Add `'b'` to `charSet`: `charSet = {'b'}`
   - Update `res`: `max(3, 7 - 7 + 1) = 3`
   - `res` remains `3`

10. **End of Iteration**:
    - All characters have been processed.
    - The final value of `res` is `3`.

### **Final Result**

The longest substring without repeating characters in `"abcabcbb"` is `"abc"`, which has a length of **3**.

### **Additional Insights**

- **Sliding Window Technique**: The algorithm uses the sliding window approach to efficiently find the longest substring without duplicates. The `left` and `right` pointers define the current window, and the `charSet` ensures all characters within the window are unique.
  
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is visited at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer).

- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m)), where m is the size of the character set (e.g., 26 for lowercase English letters).

### **Commented Code**

At the end of your provided code, there's a commented-out section. It appears to be an alternative implementation of the same logic. Here's a brief comparison:

- **Active Code**:
  - Uses variable names `res` and `charSet`.
  - Prints the initial `charSet`.
  
- **Commented Code**:
  - Uses variable names `maxLength` and `charSet`.
  - Does not print anything.
  - Slightly rearranged logic but fundamentally the same.

Both implementations achieve the same goal. The active code is ready to run and includes a print statement for debugging or educational purposes, while the commented code is a cleaner version without the print statement.

### **Conclusion**

The provided code efficiently finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters by maintaining a dynamic window of unique characters and updating the maximum length found during the iteration. Using the example `s = "abcabcbb"`, the algorithm correctly identifies that the longest such substring is `"abc"`, with a length of 3.
